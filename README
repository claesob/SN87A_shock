Shock code based on Chevalier & Fransson (1994), but with a major 
upgrade of the atomic data, as well as method.

This code, for historic reasons in Fortran 77, is used to calculate
the line luminosities from a steady state shock in a metal rich plasma. 
H or He are not included in this version, and no shock precursor is calculated. 
The ionization stages entyering the shock are set in the program. 

For compiling just do make on the Makefile, where the options for 
the compiler are set. Dependining on your computer you may have to change some 
options or compiler. It has only been tested on linux. The compiled code is called shock. 

An input file called shock_input.txt is included where different parameters 
of the calculation are set. Most of these do not need any change. 
When running the code the pre-shock density (in ccm),
the shock velocity in km/s and the ionization time scale are asked for. 
The B-field is set in 'trans()' in the file timed_hydro_shock.f. In this 
version the maximum number of depth points is 350. 

As output the 500 strongest lines are found in 'strong_lines_110.txt' and the
ionization and temperature structure in 'struc.110', where 100 is the
model number (3 digits). This is set in shock_input.txt These
files are included for the case 10^3 ccm, 75 km/s, 1.e15 s/ccm. For
other parameters especially the time step has to be adjusted.
