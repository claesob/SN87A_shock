Shock code for Science paper C. Fransson et al (2024), based on
Chevalier & Fransson (1994), but with a major upgrade of the atomic
data, as well as method.

This code, for historic reasons in Fortran 77, was used to calculate
the line luminosities from a shock for the Science paper 'Ionizing
radiation from a compact object in SN 1987A'. H or He are not included
in this version. No shock precursor is calculated. The ionization
stages are set in the program. Input file called shock_input.txt is
included. Input parameters are then the pre-shock density (in ccm),
the shock velocity in km/s and the ionization time scale.

The 500 strongest lines are found in strong_lines_100.txt and the
ionization and temperature structure in struc.100, where xxx is the
model number (3 digits). These are set in the shock_input.txt These
files are included for the case 10^3 ccm, 75 km/s, 1.e15 s/ccm. For
other parameters especially the time step has to be adjusted.
